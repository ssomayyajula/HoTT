# HoTT
Project on homotopy type theory (HoTT) at Indiana University Bloomington. We formalize various results about the Pi reversible programming language in Agda.

[Here](http://ssomayyajula.github.io/files/Pi.pdf)'s a report I wrote on HoTT and this project (with an accompanying blog [post](http://ssomayyajula.github.io/posts/2017-08-02-one-really-hott-summer.html)).
